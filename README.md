# Automated-Toll-Collection-System
This project demonstrates an automated toll collection system that uses an Arduino Uno, RFID module, and a servo motor to simulate an electronic toll gate. When a registered RFID card is scanned, the system automatically opens the gate, simulating toll payment, and closes it after a delay.
